COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a strain of coronavirus. The first cases were seen in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 before spreading globally. The current outbreak was officially recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
Currently Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used for diagnosis of the COVID-19. X-ray machines are widely available and provide images for diagnosis quickly so chest X-ray images can be very useful in early diagnosis of COVID-19.
